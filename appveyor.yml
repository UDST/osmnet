# The goal here is to make sure updates to OSMnet don't introduce any Windows-specific
# runtime errors; the Travis tests running in Linux are more comprehensive. Dependencies
# are installed manually here because the shapely/geopandas stack doesn't install well
# via Pip on Windows. Only using one Python version because AppVeyor builds don't run in
# parallel and can be slow.
